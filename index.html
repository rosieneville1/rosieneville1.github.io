    <section>

            <h2>Section 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a basic chart illustrating the nuclear power generation in the UK.
                The data presented in this chart is sourced directly from an <a href="https://api.economicsobservatory.com/gbr/nGwh?vega">API</a>.

        <div class="chart-description"> <!-- we are grouping the title and description together so we can style them together -->
            <h2>Section 2: Another Chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This chart is more advanced, utilizing Vega's 'ToolTip' function and featuring a dropdown box. 
                It examines electricity generation trends over time, both globally and UK-wide.
